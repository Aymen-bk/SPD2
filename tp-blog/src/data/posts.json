      "body": "Components are one of the most powerful features of Vue.js. They help you build reusable pieces of UI that contain their own state, markup, and style. Components are the building blocks of Vue applications.\n\nA Vue component can be as simple as a button or as complex as an entire page. The key is to keep components focused on a single responsibility and make them as reusable as possible.",
